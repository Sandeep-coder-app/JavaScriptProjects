# Searching Algorithm

Searching Algorithm are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is storted.

## These Algorithm are generally classified into two categories.

### 1. Sequential Search:
In this, the list of array is traversed sequentially & every elements is checked.<br>
**EX:-** Linear Search 

### 2. Interval Search:
These Algorithm are specially designed for searching in storted DS. These type of searching algorithm are much more efficient than linear search as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure & divide the search space in half.<br>
**EX:-** Binary Search

### Interpolation Search:
The interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search for instance, where the values in a search array are uniformly distributed. Binary Search always goes to the middle element to check on the other hands, interpolation search may go to different locations according to the value of the key being searched.
